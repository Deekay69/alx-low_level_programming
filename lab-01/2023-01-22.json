I have taken some screenshots and got them onto the host machine although I think this was by luck because I cannot consistently do this. I went through and ran sudo apt install dkms and reran sudo .\/VBoxLinuxAdditions.run , and the terminal response was that it was then building the kernels, which is what happened in your video walkthrough as well. I was wondering if there was a set way of getting a screenshot from the VM to the host as that is the only part of the lab that I have not completed. Thank you!",
