        "text": "Hi Jason: Thank you for this post! This is a very useful opportunity to clarify our choices. The reasons we use VirtualBox in this class are 1) to familiarize yourself with <https:\/\/itsfoss.com\/what-is-foss\/|FOSS> as a general concept, 2) to familiarize yourself with VirtualBox ahead of time, for when you are no longer at school and may not have complimentary access to VMWare, and 3) to allow you to get started right away as the VMWare licensing is sometimes not activated by the college until a few weeks into the semester. I might suggest that you need to learn to use both. (As a side note, having had to use a non-piped water system in the past, I would not advocate for doing so by any means, but it was an immensely valuable experience that I will never forget, and one that continues to inform my decisions. Learning to do things manually is not necessarily a bad thing, even it is not your long-term MO.) Thanks again for starting this important dialogue.",
