The firewall routers that were designed to protect our networks were being compromised by a foreign adversary. This presentation details the FBI’s operation to understand this threat, and to ultimately dismantle Russia’s efforts to undermine our networks._\n\nPlease <https:\/\/utsa.zoom.us\/j\/92692483540?pwd=c3NVL3ptRitMRU1YdmRuZENyc3NBZz09|join here> (7 PM-8 PM)!\n\n_Note: Media recordings are prohibited for this presentation._",
